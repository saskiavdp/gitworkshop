# WITSOC git workshop
Group Repository for UC WitSoc git workshop


Welcome to the group repo for the git workshop!

The goal for today is to successfully get a file (not specifically code, unless you want!) from each of the other people here onto your computer.

This demonstrates the power of git and exemplifies how easy it is for group work, saving your files securely and accessing your code on any computer.

### Step One: Signing in to your git account on the lab computers.
- Open the `Terminal` (open the application finder and search it up).
- 
### Step One: Cloning the repository
