# WITSOC git workshop
Group Repository for UC WitSoc git workshop


Welcome to the group repo for the git workshop!

The goal for today is to successfully get a file (not specifically code, unless you want!) from each of the other people here onto your computer.

This demonstrates the power of git and exemplifies how easy it is for group work, saving your files securely and accessing your code on any computer.

### Step One: Create a folder and open the Terminal
Create a folder called `git workshop` or similar somewhere you will find it.\

Right click on the folder and select `Open in Terminal`.

### Step Two: Clone the repository
Click the green drop down menu that says `Code` in the top right hand corner of the page. 

Copy the HTTP link.

Go to the Terminal and type `git clone {link you cloned}`

### Step Three: Signing in to your git account on the lab computers.
